Dylan Park and Derek Sims

We received help from TA Chris Phifer on this assignment.

Everything should be correctly implemented.

In our implementation, r0 is always 0, r1 holds return addresses for 
procedures, r2 points to the callstack, r3 and r5 are nonvolatile registers,
r4 points to the valuestack, and r6 and r7 are temporary registers.

We implemented our print module by iterating through all of the elements of the
valuestack, and recursively printing the digits of each number from least to 
most significant.

We spend around 10 analyzing the assignment, 4 hours writing assembly code, and
three hours debugging.
